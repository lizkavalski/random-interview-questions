## Problem Domain:
A way to practice behavioral interview questions to feel more prepared for an interview. The reason being it can help reduce stress and help focus on connecting with interviewer according to one [website](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/job-interview-practice-how-to-rehearse-for-an-interview-2062803).

## Solution:
Create almost a flash card game with random behavioral based interview questions. With using a ‘flash card method’ it can help the user remember their answers quicker by creating a deeper connection with the [neurons in the brain](https://www.petersons.com/blog/why-flashcards-work/).

Instead of the traditional 2-side that has a prompt and the fact, I did one side which is just the prompt, or in the case just a interview question. The reason being are the questions are more open ended, and to help the user not sound like they’re a robot in a play, or reading off a card. Also the questions aren’t not track to see if the user already gotten the question because the point is to build a stronger connection in the brain.

This is done by the user clicking a button for a question. When the button is clicked it send the api to get random question from it server (you can read more “here” on the server). Then renders a questions to the user. The user then can practice how they would answer the question.
